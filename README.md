Finding the Largest Rectangle Under a Histogram

A histogram is a graphical way of representing distribution of data over a given range of points. It's often used to demonstrate probabilities of certain outcomes within a dataset. You may also have seen histograms in the context of photo editing software, where they are used as a means of representing density of light across a range of channels.
